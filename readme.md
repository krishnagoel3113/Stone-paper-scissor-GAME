# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The game allows a user to play against the computer in a 3Ã—3 grid until one wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Features
- **User vs Computer mode**: The user plays as `X`, and the computer plays as `O`.
- **Win detection**: The game identifies when the user or the computer wins or when the game results in a draw.
- **Reset functionality**: Players can restart the game at any time.
- **Planned Responsive Design**: The game is currently not fully responsive but will be updated to adapt to different screen sizes.
- **Basic AI opponent**: The computer makes random valid moves.
- **Flexbox layout**: The game board and elements are styled using CSS Flexbox for a clean design.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the game board.
- **CSS (Flexbox)**: Styling for the game layout and positioning.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for game functionality, player turns, and win detection.

2. The user (X) and the computer (O) take turns playing.
3. The first to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
